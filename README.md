## Theme Configuration

You can find the configuration files in the `src/config` directory. The configuration files are written in TypeScript and contain various settings for the theme, such as basic information, navigation bar, footer navigation, analytics, and social links. You can customize these settings to fit your specific needs.

| Configuration File               | Description                                                                                     |
| -------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `src/config/config.ts`           | Includes the basic configuration settings including SEO, mode, and scroll animations.           |
| `src/config/navigationBar.ts`    | Includes menu options for the navigation bar.                                                   |
| `src/config/footerNavigation.ts` | Includes menu options for the footer navigation.                                                |

| `src/config/socialLinks.ts`      | Contains the social link data for the website.                                                  |

### Basic configuration settings

In the `src/config/config.ts` file, you can find the basic configuration settings.
These includes the default SEO settings:

- `siteTitle`: The default title of your website.
- `siteDescription`: The default description of your website.
- `ogImage`: The open graph image for your website.
- `logo`: The logo for your website.
- `canonical`: Whether to use canonical links for your website.
- `noindex`: Prevents search engines from indexing your website if set to true.

as well as the default site settings:

- `mode`: The default mode for your website. Can be set to 'auto', 'light', or 'dark'. Auto mode will automatically switch between light and dark modes based on the user's system settings, while 'light' and 'dark' will force the site to use the corresponding mode.
- `scrollAnimations`: Whether to enable smooth scrolling animations for your website.

## Theme Customization

### Customize the Colors

The theme uses two main colors: primary and neutral. These colors are defined in the Tailwind CSS configuration file. To personalize the color scheme of your project, you can easily modify these color values.

To customize the colors, follow these steps:

1. Open the `tailwind.config.js` file.
2. Find the `theme` section within the file.
3. Under `theme`, locate the `extend` property and then the `colors` object.
4. Modify the color values for `primary` and `neutral` to suit your preferred color palette.

You can use the [tailwind CSS colors](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) or create your [own palette](https://uicolors.app/create) .

### Customize the Fonts

To customize the fonts used in your project, follow these steps:

1. **Update the Tailwind CSS Configuration**

   Open the `tailwind.config.js` file. In the `theme` section, find the `extend` property and update the `fontFamily` object.

2. **Ensure Font Packages are Installed**

   Verify that the necessary font packages are included in your `package.json` file and also imported in the `src/layouts/Layout.astro` file.

You can add your own fonts by following [this guide](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/fonts/#using-fontsource)

### Dark/Light Mode

By default, the site uses an automatic mode switcher, allowing it users to switch between light and dark modes based on the user's system settings or by using the mode switcher in the navigation bar. This is achioeved by setting the `mode-auto` class in the `Layout.astro` file.

If you need to enforce a specific theme, you can set the class above as **`mode-light`** or **`mode-dark`**. When **`mode-light`** is applied, the site will consistently display in light mode, and the switcher will not be functional. Similarly, **`mode-dark`** will force the site to dark mode, with the switcher rendered non-functional. These settings allow you to maintain a fixed appearance across the site regardless of user preferences or system settings.
